Hello world!

I am currently an AI Scientist at <a href="https://radicalnumerics.ai/">Radical Numerics</a>, where I work on agentic AI for Recursive Improvement Systems Architectures and deep learning <-> kernel optimization, among other things.

I obtained my Ph.D. in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department at KAIST, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Prof. Jinkyoo Park</a> at the <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr">Systems Intelligence Laboratory (SILAB)</a> .

My main research interests include decision-making and optimization in discrete and continuous spaces, including:

- Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO)
- Scientific Machine Learning (AI4Science)
- Agentic AI workflows for optimization and discovery

I love to work on open-source projects. I recently co-founded the <a href="https://github.com/ai4co">AI4CO</a> open research group and collaborate with <a href="https://github.com/DiffEqML">DiffEqML</a>.
