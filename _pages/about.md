Hello everyone! I'm a Master's degree student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department at KAIST where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/our-team/">Prof. Jinkyoo Park</a>.

I'm researching with my colleagues at the <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr">Systems Intelligence Laboratory</a> and my peers at the <a href="https://github.com/DiffEqML">DiffEqML</a> open research group.

My research interest is mainly focused at the intersection of these areas:
- Deep Learning
- Dynamical Systems
- Optimal Control

I believe that combining recent advances in deep learning with physical simulations and real world applications can benefit both deep learning, by introducing inductive biases based on the world we live in and thus bringing new knowledge to the learning side, while deep learning can help more "classical" approaches in prediction and control by providing ever faster and generalizable models that could achieve what was previously deemed impossible.
